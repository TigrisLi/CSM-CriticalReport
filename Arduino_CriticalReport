  printer.println(F("The Dating Incubator Lab experience is set in the speculative future, designed for two individuals who are either dating or in an established relationship looking to fall in love. As they enter the pod, they are presented with a control panel where each person must stand at opposite ends of it. On each of the two sides are five circular dials that are associated with an emotion; love, happiness, sadness, disappointment and anger. The individuals are asked to turn the dials to evaluate the amount of each emotion they feel in their current relationship with the person standing across them. Once both parties have completed this, they must press a button on the side of the control panel which also takes in their heart rate, and when both heart rates are detected, it calculates their lab results. This is done by measuring the average of each person's individual emotion to determine the statistics of their relationship’s emotional standpoint and prints out their results. From this, it also tells you the dose of oxytocin hormones required to balance out and fulfill the missing quantity needed in their relationship to fall in love. They are then presented with the option to either take the dose of oxytocin to resolve the hardships of their relationship, or they can choose to take the results and walk away. If they choose the latter, it’s up to them to decide how they communicate to either mend any difficulties in their relationship or end it."));

It’s difficult to quantify emotions and evaluate them, but with computers, this is possible because they can only process numbers and data. This proves to be an interesting way to subjectively acquire emotional information from a person and output it in an objective way through calculated statistics."));

When people are presented with all the factual data of their emotions, it can allow them to gain an insight of how they feel and provoke them to question why they feel a certain emotion at such a high or low percentage in comparison to others. This is what will increase their emotional intelligence because they are become more self-aware and gaining a deep understanding of their emotions. And in this case, they are questioning these feelings in relation to another person which can help them improve their relationship. However, there are certain limitations because even if you present all this emotional data to a person, it still ultimately comes down to the person itself to choose what they want to do with this information. All that technology can do in this case is be an enabler for those who want a deeper understanding of their own emotions and those of others to increase their EQ and help them navigate experiences and human relations."));

This has been purposely designed as I’ve used technology so it is only functional with not only the presence of a human body but more importantly, with their interactivity. There’s an interesting narrative that comes with these binary oppositions, and even more so when we place subjective factors of our humanity in it, such as emotions. Technology is unlike humans who have backgrounds of life experience that guides the way they respond and behave. Taking on the philosophy of phenomenology, we have a responsibility in restructuring the intentions of how we use available technologies to assists us in the physical world, but through a human-centred lens. This can be achieved by integrating technology as a tactile interactive medium, and we still have the power and control to dictate how we position technology within our lives and its purpose."));

The key element that makes this successful is the computer-to-human interaction within my practice being co-creational. Whereby the unique attributes to a person’s individuality are deeply taken into consideration as it produces an outcome that can only be specifically associated to them in subjective manners. This is demonstrated in Brewing Tastes of Memories which observes sensory communication through the form of smell and taste, and takes biometric data in our breathing to reflect on the emotional narratives of our memories. What’s more, the Incu-Dater criticizes the prospects of emotional shortcomings in relationships and challenges individuals to measure their feelings towards another person to determine if artificial hormones is required as a solution to any weak points."));

Being able to position technology as a tool that we co-create with to foster emotional intelligence will allow us to achieve new narratives in how we navigate the world, create meaningful relationships, and be empathetic as we become more self-aware of the emotions that shapes our being."));
